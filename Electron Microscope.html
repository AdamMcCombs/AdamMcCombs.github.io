title: Scaning Electron Microscope
---

This project stated out with an article in Make back in 2011. The article in question was one overveiwing the construction of [Ben Krasnowâ€™s DIY scanning electron microscope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdjYVF4a6iU) (SEM). At the time, I was in aw of the thing, and also instantly wanted on for myself.

This was however impractical for me at the time.  I was far to young and inexperienced to even come remotely close to having the skills to operate, much less even build or repair on of these things.  So that was that, until one day a few years latter, when searching craigslist for an optical microscope, I came across a JEOL JSM 35CF.  The unit was in relatively good shape, and more importantly was located close by in Seattle.  The only issue was of course the cost.  Coming in at around 2000$, it was of course a good deal for what it was, but well out of my price range.

The unit came and went on and off of craigslist, and that was that.  There was however one crucial development that came from this, I set up and email alert on eBay and Craigslist.

This was of course meet with much disappointment as excellent units surplussed from NASA or various semiconductor applications went up for sale, and were all either to far away, to expensive, but mostly some combination of the two.  And that brings us to the present.

In March 2017, I got an alert for a unit on eBay that was only 400$ and located  just north of Seattle, well withing my range for price and distance.  Armed with a pickup, trailer, and moving supplies, I headed up north.

The unit in qestion is a ISI Super IIIA, manufactured in Japan in 1978, and surplussed by Boeing in 2002.  The unit worked when I was decommissioned in 2002, and it came with the manual, full schematics, and some spare parts, something that would be hard if not impossible to find for this unit.

After the hour long drive, I was greeted with a surprise.  The eBay listing had shown one unit intact what I assumed to be parts of the same unit disassembled.  As it turns out, and was not noted in the listing, I had bought nearly two complete unites. The only things missing from unit two was the high voltage oil tank and the scan column.  I had everything else to unit 2 though, the the control and imaging units, the main power supply, a housing, and the vacuum valve assembly and controller.  I was ecstatic about this, one of my largest concerns with this project was where was I going to find spare parts, and as it turns out, I nearly had a complete set.

Additionally, the seller also gave me a Princeton Gama Tech x-ray spectroscopy unit, amplifier and SEM interface included (no pulse processor though, I am going to look into using [PRA 15](http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~marek/pra/) from the University of Sydney for data analysis (I have seen it used for neutron spectroscopy spectroscopy, and from looking at the setup used, it should be possibly to adapt it for x-ray).

Getting the unit home was actually relatively easy, the seller had already completely disassembled it, making it easy to load all of the components into the back of the pickup and then strap down the frames to the trailers.  It was a tight fit to get everything into the back of the pickup, but there was no way that I was going to say no to any of the additional equipment that the seller was offering me.
